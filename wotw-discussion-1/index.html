        <h2>What is usability, and why does it matter?</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Usability</dt>
            <dd>- the degree to which something is able or fit to be used.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Like the definition from the Oxford dictionary says above, usability is simply just the ability something has to be used. When it comes to web design and writing on the web we want everything to be as easy to use as possible. </p>
        <blockquote>I've always found it useful to imagine that every time we enter a Web site, we start out with a reservoir of goodwill. Each problem we encounter on the site lowers the level of that reservoir... The reservoir is limited, and if you treat users badly enough and exhaust it there's a good chance that they'll leave.<cite>Steve Krug - Chapter 11</cite></blockquote>
        <p>This quote from last weeks reading really drives home why usability is an important thing to keep in mind. If a site is hard to use and was not designed with usability in mind users are very likely to leave. If it the usability is bad enough, users that have a bad experience could spread the word and prevent others from ever entering your site in the first place. The best way to get someone to return to a site, in my opinion, is to make the usability high so that the user does not struggle to use the site.</p>
    
        <h2>What is accessibility, and why does it matter?</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Accessibility</dt>
            <dd>- the quality of being able to be reached or entered.</dd>
            <dd>- the quality of being easy to obtain or use.</dd>
            <dd>- the quality of being easily understood or appreciated.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>I included all three of these definitions from the Oxford dictionary because there are parts of each that directl apply to web design. I would define <strong>Web Accessibility</strong> as the quality of a web site to be reached, used, or understood. </p>
        <blockquote>Essentially, web accessibility refers to the ability for people with any sort of disability, including auditory, visual, speech, cognitive, and neurological disabilities, to be able to access the web.<cite>Garenne Bigby - telerik.com</cite></blockquote>
        <p>Accessibility is important because it is what makes your site inclusive of everyone, despite their disabilities. This is as simple as proper hierarchy in your heading tags, alternate attributes for all of your images, even the fonts and colors you use in your text can affect the accessibility of the site. The steps to make sure your site is accessible as possible are easy and should definitely never be overlooked.</p>
        
        <h2>How are these two concepts related?</h2>
        <blockquote>When it comes to web accessibility vs. usability, it’s important to remember the key difference: web accessibility is focused on the actual ability to access information, whereas usability is focused on the end user’s experience.<cite>Garenne Bigby - telerik.com</cite></blockquote>
        <p>Usability and accessibility really do go hand in hand. The accessibility is the first step of the usability. A site cannot be usable if it cannot first be accessed by all types of people. There is an extra layer that adds ontop of the accessibility, and that is how easy it is to actually navigate the site once it is accessed. That is the usability of the site. </p>
        
        <h2>Website Analysis</h2>
        <a href="https://studentaid.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Student Aid</a>
        <p>This is website that I am sure almost all of us have visited at least once in our lives. I have seen this website go through a couple of different revisions since I first started college back in 2013. This latest version is the best that I have seen by far. The text really stand out from the background colors in every area. There does not appear to be anywhere on the page where colors might get lost if the user is color-blind. The thing that I find most difficult about this site is probably just the amount of links and clickable buttons that appear directly on the home page. It may be a little overwhelming to a user that has never used the site before. </p>
